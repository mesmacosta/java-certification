Chapter 5
=========

* The `switch` statement can handle ints and enums.
* The constants on `case` statement must be a compile time constant!
* A `try` must be followed by _either_ a `catch` or a `finally`.
* `assert` as identifier (variable, for instance) works using 1.3, but warns. 1.4 and beyond fails, because `assert` became a keyword.
* Enhance for loop must declare its first operand `(_int_ i: intArray)`.
* Static variables are initialized too.
* Wrapper classes as instance or class variables are initialized too, but to `null` not the primitive default value.
* A primitive on the second expression of an assert is valid! Including if it's a atribution.
* Read carefully the line numbers as there're questions that take in account the missing `import` statements.
* It's really ok for `main()` to throw exceptions.
