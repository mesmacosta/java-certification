Chapter 1
=========

* Identifiers can start with `$`.
* Contants are created using `static` and `final`.
* Event listener method names must start with `add`. Methods to unregister the listener must start with `remove`.
* Classes nonaccess modifiers: `abstract`, `final` and `strictfp`.
* `String` class is `final`.
* Interfaces can only declare constants! No regular attributes allowed.
* Interfaces can't declare static methods.
* Interfaces define instance methods! (same as above)
* Static methods can't be overridden.
* Overridding a method must match the return type.
* Class member = instance variables + methods.
* protected = package plus kids
* If there are two classes on the same file, when compiled two `.class` are created.
* An protected member inherited from another package cannot be invoked in instances, only through inheritance.
