Test Killer Noter
=================

I know it's like cheating. But I've really studied and learned a lot these days studying for SCJP exam. I don't believe someone could only read Test Killer and succeed on the exam, you got to study for real.

That said, seeing Test Killer questions is more like another simulator. With the level of difficulty of real exam questions, which also nice, because simulators tend to be harder, in purpose.

Notes
-----

* `method(String...a)` with no spaces, is valid. `method(String[]... a)` is also valid, it's an array of arrays of `String`s.
* Check the visibility of the class before checking the visibility of the member!! You stupid! :P

Result
------

15 of 20.
